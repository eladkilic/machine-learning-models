# Machine Learning Course Projects
This repository contains two machine learning projects completed as part of the Machine Learning I course. Both projects implement algorithms from scratch and explore fundamental ML concepts.

- **Course:** Machine Learning I, HTW Berlin
- **Semester**: Winter 2025/2026

## Projects

### 1. **Classification Models**
Implementation of foundational classification algorithms without using high-level ML libraries.

**Key Implementations:**
- Logistic Regression with custom cost function
- Gradient Descent optimization
- Multivariate Linear Regression
- Data normalization techniques
- Model accuracy evaluation
- Cost function visualization

### 2. **SVM & MNIST Classification**
Support Vector Machine implementation and application to digit recognition.

**Key Components:**
- Linear SVM with hinge loss function
- Custom gradient descent for SVM
- Hyperparameter tuning (C parameter)
- MNIST digit classification
- Confusion matrix analysis
- Error analysis visualization

## Technologies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
